//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function Cars(name, model, colour) {
  let Car = {
    Name: name,
    Model: model,
    Colour: colour,
  };
  console.log(Car.Name, Car.Model, Car.Colour);
}
Cars("Civic", "2000", "White");
